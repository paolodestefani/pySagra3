*A small program to manage a food stand*

A sagra is a traditional Italian food festival held in towns and villages that celebrates a local specialty, seasonal harvest, or patron saint.
This program aims to manage the food stand of the festival, from placing the order to delivering the dishes, from checking the availability of the products to takings.
It is developed in python programming language and uses a PostgreSql database for storing, managing, and providing access to data and pyside - Qt 
framework for the user interface and printing. The main development platforms are Mac OS and Windows but it should also work on all other operating systems supported by Python and Pyside6/Qt6.

Develped with:
- [python](https://www.python.org/) programming language
- [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/) PostgreSql adapter for python
- [qt](https://www.qt.io/) cross-platform application and UI framework
- [qt for python](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) the official Python bindings for Qt

The main icons used for the graphical interface are from [oxygen icon set](https://github.com/KDE/oxygen-icons)
