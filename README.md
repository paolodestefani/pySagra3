*A small program to manage a food stand*

A sagra is a traditional Italian food festival held in towns and villages that celebrates a local specialty, seasonal harvest, or patron saint
This program aims to manage the food stand of the festival, from placing the order to delivering the dishes, from checking the availability of the products to takings.
