# pySagra

*A small program to manage a food stand*

A sagra is a traditional Italian food festival held in towns and villages that celebrates a local specialty, seasonal harvest, or patron saint.
This program aims to manage the food stand of the festival, from placing the order to delivering the dishes, from checking the availability of the products to takings.
It is developed in python programming language and uses a PostgreSql database for storing, managing, and providing access to data and pyside6/Qt framework for the user interface and printing. The main development platforms are macOS and Windows but it should also work on all other operating systems supported by Python and Pyside6.
