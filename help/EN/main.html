      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>pySagra</b> stems from the need to manage the gastronomic 
	  stand of my village's festival. The activity to be managed is
	  therefore the order entry of products, typically first courses,
	  main courses, drinks, etc., the subsequent distribution of 
	  the orders, real work orders, to the various departments 
	  of the stand, for example bar, restaurant, but also pizzeria,
	  ice cream parlor, etc. The orders are placed in the
	  cash desks and must be the most quick and simple as possible.
	  Once the order has been entered it is divided by department
	  and distributed to the departments concerned. Once the 
	  department copy is printed the order it is considered 
	  automatically processed. There is no management of order 
	  fulfillment as it is superfluous for the type of activity 
	  that is carried out. Apart from this the program allows 
	  the closure of the cash register end various sales 
	  statistics. All lists, statistics including, they are 
	  printable and automatically exportable to Excel.
	  Currently, fiscal printing is not managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The features of the application can be summarized in 
	  the following points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Management of <b> events </b>: all operations come
	  always referring to a specific event (eg. Sagra del 
	  Pepper, Beer Festival, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>Management of <b> departments </b> (eg Bar, restaurant,
	  Pizzeria, etc.). Some departments may not be available for
	  specific events.
      </li>
      <li>Managing <b> sales </b> items, distinguishing them
	  in elementary items, kits (eg three of a kind: sausages + ribs +
	  chop) and menu (ex. sagra menu: beer + tris + fried potatoes).
	  The kits must be composed by themselves
	  elementary articles. Menus may contain kits.
      </li>
      <li>Management of <b> variants </b> of items (eg pizza
	  margherita without mozzarella, with salamino, etc.). The variant
	  may provide a price increase.
      </li>
      <li>Delivery management at <b> table </b> or per
	  <b> Take </b>. It is possible to check the existence of the
	  table number entered.
      </li>
      <li><b>stock level control</b>: for elementary articles
	  which interests to monitor it is possible to insert the
	  stock available. The program automatically updates the
	  availability based on sales made.
      </li>
      <li>Management of <b>sales orders</b> through a optimized form
	  aimed at achieving the maximum insertion speed with stock control
	  of the articles, total calculation, amount cashed, change, etc.
      </li>
      <li>Generation of the <b> order printing </b> for the
	  customer, for the various departments concerned and one for
	  covers. All these prints are in A5 format and optional
      </li>
      <li>Print of the <b> cashed </b> per day and half a day
      </li>
      <li>Management of various <b> sales statistics </b> even
	  comparing different events
      </li>
      <li>All <b> archives </b> (events, departments, items,
	  etc.) and the available statistics can be viewed,
	  printable A4 and <b> exportable </b> in excel
      </li>
      <li>The application is <b> cross-platform </b>:
	  developed and tested on Windows and Linux, it should work
	  correctly also on Mac OSX
	  </li>
    </ul>
